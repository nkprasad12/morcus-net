This directory is the root for all stem files.
These are split into two directories:

- nominals (which by convention also includes all indeclinable words, regardless of type)
- verbs

Each subdirectory also contains an `irregs` directory. The stems defined in `irregs` are not processed as-is, but
are subject to special expansion rules.

TODO(nkprasad12): Add some more details about this.
