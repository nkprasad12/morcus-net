## First Time Setup

morcus.net development is currently done only on Linux machines.
Before you get started, install `git` and:

- If you want to work on the Typescript code: `npm`, `node` (other Node versions will likely work, but only version `20` is run in CI and guaranteed to work)
- If you want to work on the Python code: `python3.8` (other Python versions may work, but only `3.8` is run in CI and guaranteed to work.)

### Typescript Code (Client, Server, Workers)

To start, download and run the setup script. This will clone all required repositories, perform all required setup, build the client, and start the server locally.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkprasad12/morcus-net/main/first_time_setup.sh >> setup_morc.sh && chmod +x setup_morc.sh && ./setup_morc.sh
```

In the future, you can run `./morcus.sh web` from `morcus-net` to build the client and start the server.
Common arguments for this script (run `./morcus.sh --help` for full options):

| Flag               | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--build_ls`       | This processes Lewis and Short for use by the server. This needs to be run the first time and whenever you modify the Lewis and Short raw XML file. This is slow.                              |
| `--build_sh`       | This processes Smith and Hall for use by the server. This needs to be run the first time and whenever you modify the Smith and Hall raw text file or any of the processing code. This is slow. |
| `--prod`           | Builds the client and runs the server in production mode. This is slower.                                                                                                                      |
| `--transpile_only` | Skips `typescript` type checking. This is _faster_.                                                                                                                                            |

### Python Code (ML)

From the `morcus-net` root directory, set up a `Python` virtual environment and install `Python` dependencies.

1. `python3.8 -m venv venv`
2. `source venv/bin/activate && python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `npm run setup-alatius` to set up the macronizer for local use.
4. To run NLP models, you may also need to install `stanza` and `cltk` from `pip`.

## VS Code

### Setting up formatting

After initial setup, run `npm install` to ensure you have the latest prettier config. Then, install the
[Prettier VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) by
by pressing Ctrl+P and entering `ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode`.
The project settings are already configured to use `prettier` as the default formatting for Typescript and Javascript, and `black`
as the default formatter for Python. This will also turn on format on save.

### Integrating Jest

After initial setup, install the [Jest Runner VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) by pressing Ctrl+P and entering `ext install firsttris.vscode-jest-runner`.
This will allow you to run and debug unit tests from within the VS Code UI when browsing a test file.

### ESLint Plugin

Install the [ESLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). This will add
warnings within VSCode for any ESLint errors in the code.
