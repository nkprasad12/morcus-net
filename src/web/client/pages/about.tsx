              Shoutouts also to my friends on the LLPSI and Latin Discords who
              have graciously helped and encouraged me, both on my Latin journey
              and in making this site - thanks to Aemilia, Emilia, Quintus, and
              Remus for their feedback on early versions of the dictionary.
              Special thanks to Quillful for being my guide to the (initially)
              murky world of Digital Classics, for the long ideation
              converstions, and for the thorough feedback and many great ideas
              on improving the user interface. Grátiás vóbís agó!

              Morcus Latin Tools is also installable as a standalone app
              (meaning that it will come with its own launcher icon, will not
              have clutter from the browser search bar, will have some light
              extra theming, and so on).
            </p>
            <p>
              Android users can get the app directly from the{" "}
